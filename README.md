ashenwheat
==========

akkamaddi's Ashenwheat - a small farming mod, adding four utility crops:

- Ashenwheat (a fuel, and can make charcoal),
- Ossidroot (can make Bonemeal),
- Thundergrass (can make gunpowder),
- and Scintillawheat (can make Glowstone Dust).

The goal is to make it easier to play on peaceful mode, or just farm stuff
instead of hunting for it all the time.

**Currently ported to 1.14.4 through 1.16.5**

TODO List
---------
- adjust growth rates, instead of using vanilla crop growth rate. (make use of CropGrow.Pre event?)
- a vine that grows spider eyes.
- something that grows ender pearls.
- a RARE nether thing that provides ghast tears.
- Blaze Tree - nether tree that provides blaze rods (GPL, ask Wuppy29 anyway).
- flax - crop that yields string (may require loom use?).
