ashenwheat
==========

akkamaddi's Ashenwheat - a small farming mod, adding four utility crops:

- Ashenwheat (a fuel, and can make charcoal),
- Ossidroot (can make Bonemeal),
- Thundergrass (can make gunpowder),
- and Scintillawheat (can make Glowstone Dust).

The goal is to make it easier to play on peaceful mode, or just farm stuff
instead of hunting for it all the time.

**Currently ported to 1.14.4 through 1.20.6**

TODO List
---------
- add random chance for injected loot, instead of 100% guaranteed.
- adjust growth rates, instead of using vanilla crop growth rate. (make use of CropGrow.Pre event?)
- a vine that grows spider eyes.
- <s>something that grows ender pearls.</s>
- <s>a RARE nether thing that provides ghast tears.</s> - handled in Netherrocks mod.
- <s>Blaze Tree - nether tree that provides blaze rods (GPL, ask Wuppy29 anyway).</s>
- <s>flax - crop that yields string (may require loom use?).</s>

Note on Textures and Code from Wuppy29's Mods

I discovered Wuppy29's old mods archived on GitHub at https://github.com/wuppy29/WuppyMods. The

request permission to use their ideas; however, licensing one's code under the GPL clearly
indicates intent to share their code, etc.
